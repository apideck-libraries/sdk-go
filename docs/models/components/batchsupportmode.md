# BatchSupportMode

The connector's overall batch capability: `none` when no resource supports a batch write, otherwise the mode most of its resources use. This is a summary — read `resources` for the answer that applies to the resource you are calling, because a connector can be `native` for one resource and `loop` for another.

## Example Usage

```go
import (
	"github.com/apideck-libraries/sdk-go/models/components"
)

value := components.BatchSupportModeNone

// Open enum: custom values can be created with a direct type cast
custom := components.BatchSupportMode("custom_value")
```
